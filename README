Win32-IEAutomation-RapidShare version 0.01
==========================================

RapidShare is great file repository. However if users don't have premium 
account, they cannot download files in batch mode. Interactive user
operations are involved to wait certain seconds and click links.

Once you import all links, the module will take care those interactions and
save files. 

NO HACK to RapidShare. It is handled as a black box - an IE instance running 
in background. There're some hack tips on the Internet, most of them aren't
working well. If you find any of them is useful, please drop me a line.

WWW::Mechanize is an alternative. Win32::IEAutomation is more intuitive here.

There're quite a few GUI tools available, but they don't work well either.
"Rapidshare Auto Downloader" is the one that works for me most of time.
